# 42Cursus - C Piscine

This repository contains the exercises and projects completed during the **C Piscine** at 42. The C Piscine is an intensive introduction to the C language and programming fundamentals, organized into several modules and exercises designed to build strong algorithmic, logical, and project management skills.

## **Repository Structure**

The repository is organized by modules (`C00` to `C11`, `Shell00`, `Shell01`, etc.) and contains practical exercises. Each module focuses on a specific topic and is divided into exercises (`ex00`, `ex01`, etc.).

### **Main Modules**

1. **C00**: Introduction to C Programming
   - Basic operations: printing characters, alphabets, numbers.
   - Examples: `ft_putchar`, `ft_print_alphabet`.

2. **C01**: Pointers and Arrays
   - Handling pointers and basic array operations.
   - Examples: `ft_swap`, `ft_putstr`.

3. **C02**: String Functions
   - String manipulation: copying, comparing, converting.
   - Examples: `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strcapitalize`.

4. **C03**: Advanced String Functions
   - Concatenation, searching, advanced manipulation.
   - Examples: `ft_strcat`, `ft_strstr`.

5. **C04**: Utility Functions
   - Length calculation, string-to-number conversions.
   - Examples: `ft_strlen`, `ft_putnbr`.

6. **C05**: Recursion and Mathematical Algorithms
   - Factorial, power, prime numbers.
   - Examples: `ft_recursive_factorial`, `ft_sqrt`.

7. **C06**: Program Arguments Handling
   - Manipulating arguments passed to programs.
   - Examples: `ft_print_program_name`, `ft_sort_params`.

8. **C07**: Dynamic Memory Allocation
   - Creating and manipulating dynamic strings.
   - Examples: `ft_strdup`, `ft_range`.

9. **C08**: Preprocessor and Structures
   - Using macros and structures.
   - Examples: `ft_point.h`, `ft_stock_str`.

10. **C09**: Libraries in C
    - Creating and using libraries.
    - Examples: `libft_creator.sh`.

11. **C11**: Arrays and Pointers Functions
    - Advanced functions: iteration, sorting.
    - Examples: `ft_foreach`, `ft_is_sort`.

### **Additional Modules**

- **Shell00, Shell01**: Shell Scripts
  - Basic commands and automated scripts.

- **CRush00, CRush01, CRush02**: Collaborative Projects
  - Team challenges to build simple applications in C.

## **How to Use This Repository**

1. **Compiling Files**  
   Each file can be compiled independently using `gcc`:
   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o output_file source_file.c
   ```

2. **Running Shell Scripts**  
   Scripts in `Shell00` and `Shell01` can be executed directly:
   ```bash
   ./script.sh
   ```

3. **Exercise Organization**  
   Navigate through the folders (`Cxx/exyy`) to find the source file for each exercise.

## **Tools Used**

- **Norminette**: Validates code style according to 42's standards.
- **GCC**: Compiles C programs.
- **Makefiles**: Automates compilation for certain projects.

## **About the C Piscine**

The C Piscine is designed to immerse students in an intensive learning environment. Each exercise and project aims to strengthen essential skills such as:

- Precision in memory management.
- Understanding low-level concepts.
- Solving complex problems in a structured manner.
